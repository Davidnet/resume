### Summary
Data Scientist and Developer with background in maths and physics. My two passions are programming and deep learning, I consider myself a strong programmer/developer given my experience creating real world applications and my love for functional programming, however my area of interest has always been scientific computation and enjoy programming deep neural networks in tensorflow.

Data Scientist and Developer. I have knowledge in machine learning, especially deep learning, modeling and simulation, continuous optimization, heuristics, network theory. Experience in languages like 

I have experience developing mobile Augmented Reality applications, server side applications with relational and non-relational databases, web clients, distributed systems.

Organizer of Machine Learning Meetup Medellin, Machine Learning Meetup Cali, NeuraLab project at Ruta N, Machine Learning Colombia on Facebook, and Machine Learning Colombia on Github.

I am also the author of some open-source libraries:

- tensorbuilder (deep learning library)
- phi (functional programming in python)
- karma (MVC framework for Unity3D)
- cybrain (neural networks)
